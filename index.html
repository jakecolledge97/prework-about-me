      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, World! I am a hair stylist working for Hairhouse Warehouse. 
        I have worked in many different salons and met many people. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in adelaide, and I currently still live in adelaide; 
        however I would love to travel overseas in the future, and possible stay there if the opportunity arose.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I own 2 'classic' Japanese cars with which I tinker with in my spare time.
        I also create and listen to many different styles of music. I own many Guitars and have been a vocalist in a heavy metal band.
        I love going to live shows and meeting different people from the different genres (covid-19 has made this incredibly difficult). 
        I have always had a love of computers and technology and considered this a hobby but decided I would like to possibly turn this hobby into a career. 
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Designing Websites/Programs/Applications for companies would be my first thought, 
        however I am looking forward to learning about any other job opportunities that will present themselves through this pathway.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Aberfoyle Park, South Australia</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web develping will give me a chance to truely test my creative and technical side. 
        I want to test myself and learn a new skill that can possibly land me on a new career path.
